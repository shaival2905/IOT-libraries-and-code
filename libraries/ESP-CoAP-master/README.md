# thingTronics ESP8266 12E Arduino Library
This is a Arduino Library for the ESP8266 12E.

## ESP-CoAP server/client library for Arduino
This repo contains CoAP protocol for operationg ESP-12E as CoAP server and as CoAp client.

## IETF CoAP RFC 7252
<a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7252/">RFC 7252</a> simple server library for Arduino.

## Repository Contents
* **/examples** - Example sketches for the library (.ino). Run these from the Arduino IDE. 
* **/src** - Source files for the library (.cpp, .h).
* **library.properties** - General library properties for the Arduino package manager.
* **library.json** - General library properties for the Arduino package manager in JSON format
* **keywords.txt** - Contains the keywords for Arduino IDE.

This lightweight library source code have only 4 files. coapServer.cpp, coapServer.h, coapClient.cpp, coapClient.h .

## Example
Some sample sketches for Arduino included(/examples/).

 - coapserver.ino: simple server endpoint url callback sample.
 - coapclient.ino: simple client response callback sample.

## How to use
Download this source code branch zip file and extract to the Arduino libraries directory or checkout repository. Here is checkout on Ubuntu.

    cd $HOME/Downloads/Arduino/libraries/
    git clone https://github.com/automote/ESP-CoAP
    # restart Arduino IDE, you can find ESP-CoAP examples.

### working with CoAP server
 - Upload the server example code to ESP-12E and open Serial Monitor to get the IPaddress of ESP-12E(server)
 - Run the coap client(web browser) with following URI coap://IPaddress:default port number/resource, to connect to ESP-12E server.

### working with CoAP client
 - Upload the client example cose to ESP-12E, check the working by taking ETH Zurich as server.
