\mainpage MD_UISwitch Library

This library uniformly encapsulates the use of different types of switches 
for user input devices. The library is easily extended for additional 
switch types through a class heirarchy and inheritance model, following 
the code for existing switch types.

The library includes the following features:
- Software debounce for all switch types.
- Automatically detect switch press, double press, long press and auto repeat.
- Can work with low/high or high/low transitions.
- All software timers are configurable for fine tuning to specific applications. These include:
 + debounce time.
 + double press time.
 + long press time.
 + auto repeat period time.

Switch arrangements handled by the library are:
- Momentary on type switches (MD_Switch_Digital class)
- Analog resistor ladder switches (MD_Switch_Analog class)
- Keypad matrix (MD_Switch_Matrix class)
- Keypad matrix using 4017 IC (MD_Matrix_4017KM class)
